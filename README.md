## About me and my carrer

My name is Tobias (aka Tobi) and after a few years of working in different e-commerce companies.
The role I have filled in these companies always had something to do with procut data and content management.

One of my biggest projects was to integrate a new software (Akeneo PIM) for the product data management team (wich was my team) together with internal (project management, IT, etc.) and external steakholdern.

Due to my interest and my experiences, working with software developers and to have some friends working in this area, I found "neue Fische" and the [web developer bootcamp](https://www.neuefische.de/bootcamp/web-development).

I started my new adventure in july 2023 and I'm realy hyped for this new part of my life ✨

## A few lasts words

I'm really looking forward to this new chapter of my life and, besides the coding, meeting great people with positiv energy from whom I can still learn.

Thank you for your time to get me known a little bit better!

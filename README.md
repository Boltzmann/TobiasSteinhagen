# Hey there, welcome to my page ‚úåÔ∏è

My name is Tobias (aka Tobi) and after a few years of working in different e-commerce companies, my way led me to web development.
The role I have filled in these companies always had something to do with procut data and content management.

One of my biggest prjects was to integrate a new software (a PIM system) together with internal and external steakholdern.

After that, my next logic step, regarding my interests and my experiences in different projects and teams, led me to "neue Fische" and the Web-Dev Bootcamp.

To get my head clear from all the new knowledge and experiences ü§Ø, I found for my self the following hobbies:

- Crossfit
- Cooking
- Yoga (just for myself, nothing fancy üßò)
- Hiking

I'm really looking forward to this new chapter of my life and, besides the coding, meeting great people with positiv energy from whom I can still learn something.

Thank you for the time!
